# Basic Blog

This small training project was created following the [The Ruby on Rails Guides: Getting Started](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) up to section 9.2.

As extra credit the CSS style was added.

In the course of this little practice the blog app was deployed using the services of railway.com.
